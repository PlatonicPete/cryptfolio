Features required of this app:

1. Display current holdings on different exchanges in visual and numerical format
2. Display trader performance parameters
3. Display trader value growth
4. Display trade history, visually and numerically
5. Display portfolio and holdings history

Hypothetical fantasy ideas:
output pine scripts that can be pasted into TradingView to display trade history

So we need:
 a. Connections to exchange APIs
 b. Trade history fetching
 c. Account value fetching
 d. Analysis and processing of fetched data
 e. Storage and output of fetched and processed data
 

A. Connections to exchange APIs

Use the Requests module to connect to HTTP Apis of exchanges

B.
